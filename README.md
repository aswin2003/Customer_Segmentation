# Customer Segmentation

This project focuses on customer segmentation using the "Online Retail" dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail). The goal is to analyze customer behavior and group them into distinct segments based on their purchasing patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found at the following link: [Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)

The dataset contains transactional data of an online retail store, including information about customers, products, and purchase details.

## Project Description

In this project, we aim to perform customer segmentation using various techniques such as RFM analysis, clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means), or any other relevant methodologies.

The steps involved in this project are as follows:

1. Data preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and removing duplicates.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing key features and visualizing relationships between variables.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features if necessary to enhance segmentation accuracy.
4. RFM Analysis: Calculating Recency-Frequency-Monetary value scores for each customer.
5 Clustering Algorithms: Applying K-means clustering or any other suitable algorithm to segment customers based on their RFM scores.
6 Evaluating Results: Assessing the quality of the generated clusters and interpreting meaningful insights from each segment.
